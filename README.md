# 🐕 GoFido! The App For Dog Walkers &nbsp; ![MIT Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)


# Description

GoFido is a Node.js application utilizing Sequelize, Express, Handlebars, and the FullCalander API, which aims to help self employed dog walkers to manage their client database. This application provides a secure and accessible place to store client information, as well as maintain a schedule of when each dog should be walked. Each client’s stored information may be updated or deleted, and new clients can be added. The available calendar provides a tidy visual outlining which clients' pets are to be walked and at what time, all visibile within a glance. The required login upon launch and password encryption ensures that sensitive client information remains secure at all times.
